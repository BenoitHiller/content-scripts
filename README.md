# My Content Scripts

This is a collection of little content scripts I have set up for use with chrome. They are probably not terribly useful to anyone else but if you want to write your own it is a good example of how to go about that.

## Usage

Clone the repository into a folder, then in chrome://extensions load the folder as an unpacked extension.

If you make your own changes and additions you just have to go back and click the reload button on the extension in the list.

Note you may want to look through `manifest.json` and disable any scripts you don't find useful.
